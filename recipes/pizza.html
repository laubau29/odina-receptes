        <li>- Sliced black olives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Pizza Dough:</li>
        <li>- In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>- In a large mixing bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>- Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Place it in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Pizza Sauce:</li>
        <li>- In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>- Add crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Assemble and Bake the Pizza:</li>
        <li>- Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as high as it will go.</li>
        <li>- Roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness on a floured surface.</li>
        <li>- Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread the homemade sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>- Add a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>- Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>- Remove from the oven, let it cool for a moment, slice, and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
